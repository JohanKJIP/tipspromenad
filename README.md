# Tipspromenad

A website used for tipspromenad ("quiz walk"). The game is a quiz game where the participating teams find questions while walking around e.g. a house. The game starta by having each team scan the registration QR-code with their phones to register the team. That device will then be given a cookie to identify the team when they answer the quesitons. Each question has its own QR-code which the participants can scan to read and answer the question with their phone. When Everyone has answered the question, the game leader can view the results at the ´/results´ endpoint.
